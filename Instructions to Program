Hey, this is Anmol giving an instruction of how to use it. 

1) This can only be done on a PC
2) A good IDE is required. Only installing python won't do the work.
You can install IDEs like PyCharm, VS Code, Vidual Studio or PyDev
3) Install required modules with a code line
----------->> `pip install PyQt5 PyQtWebEngine` <<------------
4) One thing doesn't work in it
it is: Viewing Page Source
5) Report any bug here on GitHub or I'm available
